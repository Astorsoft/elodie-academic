# Biography

I am is a researcher in Cognitive NeuroSciences. Currently, I am working as a postdoc in KIND (Karolinska Institutet center for Neurodevelopmental Disorders) where I am responsible for the Neuroimaging section. I am studying autism in babies and children from a neuroanatomical point of view.

Specifically, I am working on 8 to 25-year-old twins who are either discordant or concordant for autism, or typically developing twins.I am participating in the MRI scanning of those children and analyzing obtained anatomical brain images.

A second part of my job involves babies with autism risk factor (i.e. who have at least one autistic sibling). I collect cerebral eye-tracking data, cerebral electric activity (EEG) and Magnetic Resonance Images in 5-month-olds.

The goal of my current research: finding neurobiomarkers of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Since it is unlikely to find one marker for such a heterogeneous disorder, our approach is to characterize deeply our participants in order to stratify them. Specific deficits linked to ASD might correspond to specific anatomical cerebral differences. From these differences, the ultimate goal is to provide individually tailored help or treatment.

I completed my phD in June 2012 under the supervision of [Christophe Pallier](http://www.pallier.org/w/index.php) in the [Cognitive Neuroimaging Unit](http://www.unicog.org/pm/pmwiki.php) in Neurospin, near Paris, France. Then, I worked as a postdoc on dyslexia in the [Cognitive Sciences and Psycholinguistic Lab](http://www.lscp.net/) at the ENS in Paris, in [Franck Ramus](http://www.lscp.net/persons/ramus/en/index.html)â€˜ team.  My scientific interest are widespread. During my phD, I focused on Language and Music domains inquiring the following questions:

* How and when do toddlers acquire/use syntactic knowledge?
* How do syntactic and prosodic knowledge constrain possible meaning for unknown words?
* How do they constrain lexical access?
* What is the neural substrate for syntactic structure processing?
* Are neural networks implicated in linguistic hierarchical structure building also recruited by other domains such as music?
* Does musical expertise influence perception and neural processing of musical hierarchical structures?
